To Run the Project :
python <file_name>.py

Ex: python ReviewSummarizer.py

Python program will ask to enter local host url to get the input for generating review
summary. Sample Input files are provided along with this submission. You can choose any file as input
for this program. But it is necessary that those html input must be hosted on localhost, as I used
same kind of set up to examine the results.

Sample output is added in separate file. Please look for the sample input and output format
used by this project. 

Once started, project prompts to enter input url (localhost html review page). It also ask for
reduction size you would like to see the output. Based on input provided, project generates
three different summary from three approaches 1) Naive Based Summary 2) Title Based Summary
3) Text Rank Based Summary.

Finally, evaluation is also shown in terms of time taken by each algorithm to prepare the
summary.
